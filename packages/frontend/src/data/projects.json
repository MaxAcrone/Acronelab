Developed by Max Acrone Studio in 2022, this project combines a unique NFT collection with an innovative P2E (Play-to-Earn) game set in the DevilTroid metaverse. Players can develop their districts, recruit demon gangs, and engage in strategic battles for territory control. The game features multiple factions, farming systems, staking mechanics, and various battle modes including PVP and PVE. Each victory rewards players with $DTC tokens and district upgrades. The project also includes a DevilPass system for additional rewards and future features like Mutations, Area Defense, and DAO governance. Groof Street is more than just NFTs - it's a complete gaming ecosystem where demons are your friends and strategic thinking leads to victory. | Discord: https://discord.gg/T4g6rwET | Twitter: https://x.com/GroofStreet | Website: https://groofstreet.com",

We worked with an indie record label to build SoundSphere, an NFT music platform where tracks come alive with motion visuals. The hardest part was syncing visual effects in real time with blockchain-protected audio streams. After several failed attempts, we built a custom Python backend that perfectly matched beats with visuals. Fans could not only own music but also interact with it—unlocking hidden layers of animation with each playback. The project was awarded recognition at a regional Web3 Hackathon for \"Best User Experience.\"",

Collaborating with a small animation studio gave us crucial feedback, and soon the platform became their go-to solution.

Completion rates skyrocketed, as learners could showcase NFTs as proof of skills on LinkedIn. The academy later reported a 40% increase in retention.
